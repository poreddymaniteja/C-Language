2. Write a function that takes two numbers, a and n as input arguments and returns the value of a to the power of n.

3. Write a function that takes two numbers a and b as input arguments and returns their product as return value , without using * operator.

4. Write a function that takes two numbers a and b, and returns the quotient after dividing a with b.

5.  Write a function that takes two numbers a and b, and returns the remainder after dividing a with b.

6. Write a function that takes an integer number as input and prints its multiplication table.return type is  void.

7. write a function that can take an integer as input and return 1 if the number is prime number,  return 0 if it is not prime and print appropriate output message in main according to output.

A. int add (int a, int b) // to be called when user chooses +
B. int sub (int a,int b) // to be called when user chooses -
C. int mul(int a, int b) // to be called when user chooses *
D. int quotient(int a, int b) // to be called when user chooses /
E. int remainder(int a,int b) // to be called when user choose%

10. Write a function to accept a year as input and return 1 if the year is a leap year, otherwise 0.

11. Write a function to accept a month and year as input, and return the number of days in that month as output. print the number of days in main.
